* The documentation is [here](http://www.leofs.org/docs/getting_started.html#quick-start)
* The packages are [here](http://www.leofs.org/#download_package)
* Building leofs from source code:
  * Prepare
    * "leofs" uses [rebar](https://github.com/rebar/rebar) build system. Makefile so that simply running "make" at the top level should work.
    * "leofs" requires [Erlang R15B03-1](http://www.erlang.org/download_release/16) or Higher
  * Build and create "leofs" package

```text
$ git clone https://github.com/leo-project/leofs.git
$ cd leofs
$ make
$ make release
