    * Different than other DFS â€” LeoFS offers a number of unique benefits to users:
       * HIGH cost performance
       * HIGH Reliability
       * HIGH Scalability
* S3 Compatible

Quick Start
-------------

* Prepare
  * "leofs" uses the "rebar" build system. Makefile so that simply running "make" at the top level should work.
    * [rebar](https://github.com/basho/rebar)
  * "leofs" requires [Erlang R14B04](http://www.erlang.org/download_release/12).
* Build and Package

```text
$ git clone https://github.com/leo-project/leofs.git
$ cd leofs
$ make
$ make release
````

* Modify Configuration File: [detail](http://www.leofs.org/docs/install.html#set-up-leofs-s-system-configuration-only-leofs-manager)
* Operate on "Manager Console": [detail](http://www.leofs.org/docs/admin_guide.html#system-operation)

```text
## Need to modify configuration files - 
##     manager_master: leofs/package/leofs/manager_0/etc/app.config
##      manager_slave: leofs/package/leofs/manager_1/etc/app.config
##            storage: leofs/package/leofs/storage/etc/app.config
##            gateway: leofs/package/leofs/storage/etc/app.config

$ cd package/leofs
$ manager_0/bin/leo_manager start
$ manager_1/bin/leo_manager start
$ storage/bin/leo_storage start

## Need to operate on "LeoFS-Manager's Console" -

$ gateway/bin/leo_gateway start

## Confirm LeoFS's Status on "LeoFS-Manager's Console" - 
##     - Command: [STATUS]
